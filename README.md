# Password Generator

## Introduction
Welcome to my fifth project in the "100 Days of Python" challenge, hosted on this GitHub repository. The PyPassword Generator is a Python script designed to create secure and random passwords based on user-defined criteria.

## Project Description
This Python script generates a random password that includes a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. The user can specify the number of each type of character they want in their password. This flexibility allows for the creation of a password that balances memorability with security.

## Features
* Customizable Password Composition: Users can choose the number of letters, symbols, and numbers in their password.
* Randomization: The script uses Python's random module to ensure each character in the password is randomly selected.
* Secure and Unpredictable: By shuffling the chosen characters, the script ensures the password is not easily guessable.
## How to Use
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Run python password_generator.py 
When prompted, input your preferences for the number of letters, symbols, and numbers in your password.
The script will generate and display your new random password.
## Customizing Your Password
You will be asked three questions:
* "How many letters would you like in your password?"
* "How many symbols would you like?"
* "How many numbers would you like?"
Based on your input, the script will create a password that matches your criteria, ensuring a unique and strong password every time you use it.

Feel free to modify the script or add more character options to suit your specific security needs. Enjoy creating secure passwords effortlessly!
